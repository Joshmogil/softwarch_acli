Given the complexity of the task, we will need to create several files to handle different aspects of the application. Here's a high-level overview of the files and their purposes:

1. `app.py`: This will be the entry point of our application. It will initialize our Flask application and route the HTTP requests to the appropriate controller methods.

2. `controllers.py`: This file will contain our controller class. The controller will handle the communication between the model and the view.

3. `models.py`: This file will contain our model class. The model will handle the business logic of our application, such as keeping track of the user's skill level, generating learning resources, and quizzing the user.

4. `views.py`: This file will contain our view functions. The view will handle the presentation logic of our application, such as rendering the HTML templates and processing the user's input.

5. `openai_api.py`: This file will contain the functions for interacting with the OpenAI API.

6. `templates/`: This directory will contain our HTML templates.

7. `static/`: This directory will contain our static files, such as CSS and JavaScript files.

8. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the Python packages that our application depends on.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
