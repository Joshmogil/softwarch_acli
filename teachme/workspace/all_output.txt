Given the complexity of the task, we will need to create several files to handle different aspects of the application. Here's a high-level overview of the files and their purposes:

1. `app.py`: This will be the entry point of our application. It will initialize our Flask application and route the HTTP requests to the appropriate controller methods.

2. `controllers.py`: This file will contain our controller class. The controller will handle the communication between the model and the view.

3. `models.py`: This file will contain our model class. The model will handle the business logic of our application, such as keeping track of the user's skill level, generating learning resources, and quizzing the user.

4. `views.py`: This file will contain our view functions. The view will handle the presentation logic of our application, such as rendering the HTML templates and processing the user's input.

5. `openai_api.py`: This file will contain the functions for interacting with the OpenAI API.

6. `templates/`: This directory will contain our HTML templates.

7. `static/`: This directory will contain our static files, such as CSS and JavaScript files.

8. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the Python packages that our application depends on.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:

app.py
```python
from flask import Flask
from controllers import LearningController

app = Flask(__name__)
controller = LearningController()

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    return controller.index()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, let's create the `controllers.py` file:

controllers.py
```python
from flask import request, render_template
from models import LearningModel

class LearningController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LearningModel()

    def index(self):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            topic = request.form['topic']
            resources = self.model.generate_resources(topic)
            return render_template('index.html', resources=resources)
        else:
            return render_template('index.html')
```

Next, let's create the `models.py` file:

models.py
```python
from openai_api import generate_text, grade_answer

class LearningModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.skill_level = 0

    def generate_resources(self, topic):
        text = generate_text(self.skill_level, topic)
        return text

    def grade_answer(self, question, answer):
        grade = grade_answer(question, answer)
        self.skill_level = (self.skill_level + grade) / 2
        return self.skill_level
```

Next, let's create the `openai_api.py` file:

openai_api.py
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

def generate_text(skill_level, topic):
    prompt = f"The user's skill level is {skill_level}. Please provide a short explainer about the topic {topic}."
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci-codex", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=100)
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def grade_answer(question, answer):
    prompt = f"The question is: {question}. The user's answer is: {answer}. Please grade the answer on a scale of 0 to 100."
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci-codex", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=10)
    return int(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

Next, let's create the `views.py` file:

views.py
```python
from flask import render_template

def index(resources=None):
    return render_template('index.html', resources=resources)
```

Next, let's create the `templates/index.html` file:

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Learning App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="topic" placeholder="Enter a topic">
        <input type="submit" value="Learn">
    </form>
    {% if resources %}
        <p>{{ resources }}</p>
    {% endif %}
</body>
</html>
```

Finally, let's create the `requirements.txt` file:

requirements.txt
```txt
flask
openai
```

Please note that this is a simplified version of the application. There are many details that are not covered, such as error handling, user authentication, and user interface design. Also, the OpenAI API key is hardcoded in the `openai_api.py` file, which is not a good practice. In a real-world application, you should store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables or a secure key vault.
